# Big Data Analytics

This is repository containing my notes for studies at Big Data Analytics 
at Wrocław Univeristy of Science and Technology. 

The files here are under the **beerware** license - you may use them for your own educational purposes, but you may not take credits or fake ownership (for students ie. use those programs to pass your classes) and you may buy me, or other author if speciefied, a beer next time we meet.

Folders for each course contain lecture notes in pdf files. Sometimes also
extra folder */lab* or  */class* which contain materials from laboratories 
or classes.

There may be some missings, don't expect miracles.
